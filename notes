Replay Memory
  Used to train DQN
  Stores transitions agent observes to be reused
  Random sampling of transitions to form a decorrelated batch to greatly stabilize/improve training

  Two classes
    Transition:
      named tuple representing single transition. 
      maps (state, action) to (next_state, reward) the result
        state: screen difference imaage
    ReplayMemory
      cyclic buffer holding transitions
      contains sample() method to select random batch of transitions for training
